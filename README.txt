Findings: 
Overall, if a driver had visited any of the business types offering coupons more than once, they were more likely to accept a coupon than drivers who hadn't visited those business types one time in a month. However, when other factors were considered, a driver who frequented a business type more than 4 times was not much more likely to accept a coupon than those who visited more than once a month. Additionally, the nicer the weather, the greater the acceptance rates. Coffee house coupons were offered the most during this promotional period and While coffee house coupons had the highest number of acceptanes, they also had the highest number of declines so, proporationally, their rate of acceptance weren't as high as some of the other coupon types. On average, the drivers that had no urgent place to go were more likely to accept any type of coupon, regardless of whether or not they were with a passenger, and regardless of their income. Interestingly, other than the more expensive restaurants ($20-$50), the lowest and highest income groups were nearly the same, with a slight swing towards the lowest income group being more likely to accept coupons regardless of thier target destination. The most successful coupon types were carry out & takeaway coupons as well as restaurants under $20 regardless of income group, target destination or passenger status. 

Recommendations:
The data set (hypothetically) was based on a survey so, from a feasibility perspective, it would be difficult for Amazon to identify if drivers have passengers and what kind of passenger they are in real time. Further, if Amazon has consistent tracking data of driver's home and work routines, they could offer more coupons to drivers that were not headed anywhere urgently or had frequented certain businesses more than one time that month. At the very least, and likely the lowest cost per RIO would be to:
Offer more coupons during nicer, warmer weather
Offer more coupons for carry out/takeaway as well as restaurants under $20 especially to those drivers making less than $62499.
